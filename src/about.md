I'm a former UX/UI designer and graphic designer. Now, I'm pivoting to learning programming and GIS, so I can interpret data. So follow me as I try to (finally) complete courses like [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) certification, [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science), [The Coding Train's creative beginner coding courses](https://thecodingtrain.com/guides/getting-started), and [Javascript for Designers](https://www.superhi.com/courses/javascript-for-designers).

I'm studying to become a better researcher, some of my interests are mass media, local government, techno-facism, conspiracy, and race studies, and other things that look like weird niche until they it starts directly impacting daily life. As a UX/UI designer, I helped organizations design and build a vision for digital media and products through visual, interactive, and motion graphics.
