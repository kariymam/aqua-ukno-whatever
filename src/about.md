As a UX/UI designer, I helped organizations design and build a vision for digital media and products through print, web, apps, and motion graphics. Today, I'm learning how to become a better writer, amd how to use design, data and the web to realize my ideas, so I can interpret data. So follow me as I try to complete courses like [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) certification, [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science), [The Coding Train's creative beginner coding courses](https://thecodingtrain.com/guides/getting-started), and [Javascript for Designers](https://www.superhi.com/courses/javascript-for-designers).

Some of my interests are making playlists, cooking, gardening, researching techno-facism, conspiracy, learning Portuguese, and power structures.
